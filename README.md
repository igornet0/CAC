**CAC (CodeAgentCreator)** is an intelligent machine learning model that accepts natural language development requests and automatically generates application prototypes like a professional full-stack developer. Built on the powerful Qwen3-Coder-480B model, CAC transforms your ideas into working code prototypes with minimal human intervention.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept development requests in plain English
- **Full-Stack Development**: Generate both frontend and backend components
- **Professional Code Quality**: Follows industry best practices and coding standards
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly transform ideas into working prototypes
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate code in various programming languages
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Leverages advanced AI to understand context and requirements
- **Autonomous Development**: Works independently to solve complex development tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

CAC is built on top of the **Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct** model, a state-of-the-art large language model specifically fine-tuned for code generation tasks. The architecture includes:

- **Model Backend**: Qwen3-Coder-480B for advanced code understanding and generation
- **Tokenization**: Advanced tokenization for natural language to code translation
- **Generation Engine**: High-performance text generation with up to 65,536 tokens output
- **Device Optimization**: Automatic device mapping for optimal performance

### Technology Stack

- **Core Model**: Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Package Management**: Poetry
- **License**: MIT

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing CAC, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.12 or higher**
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (recommended for optimal performance)
- **Minimum 32GB RAM** (64GB+ recommended for large models)
- **High-speed internet connection** (for model download)
- **Sufficient disk space** (~1TB for model storage)

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igornet0/CAC.git
cd CAC
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using Poetry (recommended):

```bash
# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install project dependencies
poetry install
```

Using pip:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install transformers>=4.53.3
```

### 3. Environment Setup

The model will automatically download on first run. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection.

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Initialize the model
model_name = "..."
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create a development request
prompt = "Create a REST API for a todo application with CRUD operations"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

# Generate code
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=65536
)

# Extract and decode response
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):]
    for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

### Command Line Usage

Run the main script directly:

```bash
# Using Poetry
poetry run python main.py

# Using Python directly
python main.py
```
